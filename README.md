# Data Collection Algorithm

This algorithm is designed to collect a set of data related to a specific keyword. This data can be used to train an AI model, for example, an image classification model. Here is how the algorithm works:

## Prerequisites
This algorithm requires the simple_image_download library. If you don't have it, you can install it using pip:

``python
pip install simple_image_download
```

## Algorithm

1. Import the simple_image_download library:

``python
from simple_image_download import simple_image_download as simp
```

2. Define the keywords you want to use to find pictures:

``python
keywords = ["keyword1", "keyword2", ...]
```

3. Loop over the keywords and download the images:

``python
response = simp.simple_image_download
for kw in keywords:
    response().download(kw, 300)
```

Note: Make sure to specify the appropriate number of samples to download based on your use case. Also, ensure that the downloaded images have appropriate licenses for your use case.
